ccle_cnv_byGene	Affymetrix	SNP6.0 arrays	Raw Affymetrix CEL files were converted to a single value for each probe set representing a SNP allele or a copy number probe. Copy numbers were then inferred based upon estimating probe set specific linear calibration curves, followed by normalization by the most similar HapMap normal samples. Segmentation of normalized log2 ratios (specifically, log2(CN/2)) was performed using the circular binary segmentation (CBS) algorithm.	http://www.broadinstitute.org/ccle/downloadFile/DefaultSystemRoot/exp_10/ds_20/CCLE_copynumber_byGene_2013-12-03.txt.gz?downloadff=true&fileId=17599	07/10/2015
