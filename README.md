# Magpie GitHub Pages Notes

### Adding blog posts
To add a new blog post, create a new markdown, HTML, or textile file in the `/_posts` directory.  The file name should looks something like this: `2015-06-01-hello-world.md`, where `2015-06-01` is the date the post will be timestamped, `hello-world` is the slug name for the post, and `.md` is the extension for the markup format.  Regardless of the markup format, the post file should have a YAML header with the post metadata:

```YAML
---
layout: post
author: "Will Oemler"
title: "Welcome to Project Magpie"
tags: news
---
```

Be sure to include the `author` and `title` attributes in the header.  The `tags` attribute is optional, but may be useful in the future.  Always use the `post` layout for blog posts. If you don't want the post to publish, you can include `published: false` in the header.

Once published, the post should appear on the Blog page, and should be reachable at the URL generated by the file name: eg. `/2015/06/01/hello-world`.
